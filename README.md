# 👋 Hi there, I'm Atharva!

I'm a data analyst with a background in psychology and a passion for uncovering insights through machine learning, visualization, and predictive modeling. I'm currently pursuing a Post-Graduate Diploma in Data Science at NAIT and building hands-on projects in real estate analytics, Airbnb pricing, and more.
